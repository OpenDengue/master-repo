# OpenDengue

The OpenDengue project aims to build and maintain a database of dengue case counts for every dengue-affected country worldwide since 1990. We collate data from a range of publicly available sources including ministry of health websites, peer-reviewed publications and other disease databases. Please visit our [website](https://opendengue.org) to learn more about our project and methods.
