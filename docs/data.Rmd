## Data definitions
The OpenDengue dataset contains reported total case counts with each row corresponds to a unique location and time. 

Where reported, we include dengue cases at all levels of severity (dengue, dengue with/without warning signs, severe dengue, dengue haemorhaggic fever, dengue shock syndrome, dengue deaths) and methods of confirmation (suspected, probable, clinically confirmed, laboratory confirmed) in the variable `dengue_total`. The specific case definition used for a particular data point  will depend on the original data source. The data source can be identified by looking up the record `UUID` in the `metadata.csv` file which can be found in the [OpenDengue Github repo](https://github.com/OpenDengue/master-repo). This will include a URL reference to the original public data source. Future versions of the OpenDengue data set will dissaggregate data by severity and method of confirmation where reported.

<br>
Location is encoded by text name at national (`adm_0_name`) and sub-national (`adm_1_name` and `adm_2_name`) level. Records are matched to Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL, see [UN FAO website](https://data.apps.fao.org/catalog/dataset/gaul-codes)) codes (`FAO_GAUL_code`, Admin0-2) and [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com) shapefiles (downloadable via the `rnaturalearth` [R package](https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearth)) using [ISO alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) (admin0) and [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) (admin1) standards.

<br>
Time periods are recorded using a start date (`calendar_start_date`) and end date (`calendar_end_date`) with the format `YYYY-mm-dd`.

## Limitations
* Dengue surveillance, reporting and accessibility of data varies between countries, sources and, sometimes, over time which can make comparisons invalid. Please check the consistency  of original sources if making comparisons.
* In all countries reported cases are likely to only be a small subset of total dengue infections due to many asymptomatic and sub-clinical infections.
